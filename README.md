# weaver
A tool to help get really good scores in weaver.

To do:
1. Make copy of list of words
2. Import list of words
3. Add way to remove words from list if they don't appear in the game
4. Add way to input first and last words
5. Find words in the list that change one letter each time
6. Add fail safe to stop looping - maybe have another copy of the list that each time a word is used it will be removed - this means that the only instance of that word is the one that took the shortest to get through?
7. Once one branch gets to the answer, print that branch
